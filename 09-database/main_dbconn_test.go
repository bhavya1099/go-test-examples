```
Scenario 1: Successful database connection creation

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function dbConn successfully creates a database connection without any errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific setup required.
    Act: Call dbConn() function.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned db object is not nil.
  Validation:
    By checking that the db object is not nil, we confirm that the function was able to establish a connection to the database, which is essential for the application to interact with the database.

Scenario 2: Error handling when failing to connect to the database

Details:
  Description: This test validates the error handling mechanism when the function fails to connect to the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Simulate an incorrect database configuration.
    Act: Call dbConn() function.
    Assert: Verify that the function panics with an error message.
  Validation:
    The expected behavior in case of a connection failure is to panic and display the error message. This test ensures that the error is appropriately handled to prevent the application from continuing with a faulty database connection.

Scenario 3: Database connection with invalid credentials

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks the behavior of the function when invalid database credentials are provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use incorrect database credentials.
    Act: Call dbConn() function.
    Assert: Expect the function to panic with an error message.
  Validation:
    Verifying that the function panics with an error message in case of invalid credentials is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the application's database connections.

Scenario 4: Database connection with empty database name

Details:
  Description: This test ensures the function's response when an empty database name is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the dbName variable to an empty string.
    Act: Call dbConn() function.
    Assert: Ensure that the function panics with an error message.
  Validation:
    Handling empty database names is essential for preventing potential runtime errors or security vulnerabilities. This test confirms that the function reacts appropriately in such scenarios.

Scenario 5: Database connection with valid configuration and parseTime enabled

Details:
  Description: This test validates the function's behavior when a valid database configuration with parseTime enabled is used.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a valid database configuration with parseTime set to true.
    Act: Call dbConn() function.
    Assert: Check that the returned db object is not nil.
  Validation:
    Enabling parseTime in the database connection string allows for automatic conversion of time.Time types, which is beneficial for handling date and time data effectively in the application.

Scenario 6: Database connection performance test

Details:
  Description: This scenario aims to evaluate the performance of the dbConn function by measuring the time taken to establish a connection.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup performance measurement tools or benchmarks.
    Act: Call dbConn() function multiple times in a loop.
    Assert: Analyze the average time taken to create a database connection.
  Validation:
    Performance testing is crucial to ensure that the function can efficiently establish database connections, especially in scenarios where multiple connections are made frequently. This test helps in optimizing the function for better performance.
