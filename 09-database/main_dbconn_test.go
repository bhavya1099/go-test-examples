Scenario 1: Successful database connection creation

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can successfully establish a connection to the MySQL database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the necessary database driver, user, password, and database name.
    Act: Call the dbConn function.
    Assert: Check that the returned database connection is not nil.
  Validation:
    By ensuring that the returned database connection is not nil, we confirm that the function successfully connected to the MySQL database. This test is crucial for ensuring the application can communicate with the database.

Scenario 2: Error handling for invalid database credentials

Details:
  Description: This test validates the error handling mechanism when invalid database credentials are provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up incorrect database user or password.
    Act: Invoke the dbConn function.
    Assert: Verify that the function panics with an error message.
  Validation:
    By expecting a panic with an error message, we ensure that the function correctly handles invalid database credentials. This test is important for safeguarding against unauthorized access attempts.

Scenario 3: Error handling for unavailable database

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's behavior when the specified database is not available.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a non-existent database name.
    Act: Call the dbConn function.
    Assert: Ensure that the function panics with an error message.
  Validation:
    Verifying that the function panics with an error message in the case of an unavailable database ensures proper error handling. This test is essential for handling scenarios where the application cannot connect to the required database.

Scenario 4: Error handling for database driver issues

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function responds to problems related to the database driver.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Modify the database driver to an unsupported value.
    Act: Execute the dbConn function.
    Assert: Validate that the function panics with an error message.
  Validation:
    By confirming that the function panics with an error message upon encountering issues with the database driver, we ensure that the application can handle driver-related problems effectively. This test is critical for maintaining stability and reliability in database connections.
