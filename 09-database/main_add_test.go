```go
Scenario 1: Successful Task Addition

Details:
  Description: Test the successful addition of a new task into the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock Task struct with valid data.
    Act: Call the Add function with the mock Task.
    Assert: Verify that the returned ID is not zero and no error is returned.
  Validation:
    By checking that a non-zero ID is returned, we ensure that the task was successfully added to the database. This test is crucial as it confirms the core functionality of adding tasks.

Scenario 2: Task Addition Error - SQL Prepare

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario when an error occurs during SQL statement preparation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock Task with valid data.
    Act: Call the Add function, deliberately causing an error during SQL statement preparation.
    Assert: Ensure that the function returns an error and the returned ID is zero.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the function handles errors during SQL statement preparation correctly. It is essential to catch such errors to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.

Scenario 3: Task Addition Error - Executing Statement

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario when an error occurs while executing the SQL statement.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock Task with valid data.
    Act: Invoke the Add function, causing an error during statement execution.
    Assert: Check that the function returns an error and the returned ID is zero.
  Validation:
    Verifying the correct handling of errors during statement execution is critical to maintain data integrity. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected in error situations.

Scenario 4: Task Addition Error - Last Insert ID

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario when an error occurs while retrieving the last inserted ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock Task with valid data.
    Act: Call the Add function, causing an error during the retrieval of the last insert ID.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns an error and the returned ID is zero.
  Validation:
    By testing the handling of errors related to obtaining the last insert ID, we ensure the function's robustness in completing the task addition process. This test verifies error recovery mechanisms.

Scenario 5: Task Addition with Empty Task

Details:
  Description: Test adding an empty task to the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty Task struct.
    Act: Execute the Add function with the empty Task.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns an error and the ID is zero.
  Validation:
    Testing the function's behavior with an empty task ensures that it correctly handles edge cases where invalid data is provided. This test guards against unexpected behavior when dealing with incomplete data.

Scenario 6: Task Addition with Future Due Date

Details:
  Description: Test adding a task with a future due date.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a Task with a due date set in the future.
    Act: Call the Add function with the Task.
    Assert: Check that the function successfully adds the task and returns a valid ID.
  Validation:
    Verifying the ability to add tasks with future due dates is important for the application's functionality. This test ensures that the system can handle tasks scheduled for future completion dates.
