```go
Scenario 1: Test finding an existing task successfully

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Find function can retrieve an existing task from the database based on the provided ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock database connection and insert a sample task with a known ID.
    Act: Call the Find function with the ID of the inserted task.
    Assert: Verify that the returned Task matches the inserted task details.
  Validation:
    By comparing the retrieved Task fields with the expected values, we can confirm that the function correctly fetches task information from the database.

Scenario 2: Test finding a non-existent task

Details:
  Description: This test validates the behavior of the Find function when attempting to retrieve a task that does not exist in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure the database is empty.
    Act: Invoke the Find function with an ID that does not correspond to any task.
    Assert: Check that the function returns an error indicating the record was not found.
  Validation:
    By expecting an error message stating that the record was not found, we ensure that the function handles non-existent tasks appropriately.

Scenario 3: Test database error handling during task retrieval

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the error handling capability of the Find function when encountering issues with the database query.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Introduce a database error scenario by setting up a faulty database connection.
    Act: Call the Find function with a valid task ID.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns an error due to the database query failure.
  Validation:
    By simulating a database error, we can ensure that the function correctly propagates the error and does not mask underlying issues.

Scenario 4: Test scanning error during task retrieval

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Find function when encountering errors while scanning the retrieved task data.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Insert a task with invalid data that would cause a scanning error.
    Act: Retrieve the task using the Find function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns an error related to the scanning process.
  Validation:
    By intentionally introducing corrupt data and expecting a scanning error, we confirm that the function handles data integrity issues during retrieval.

Scenario 5: Test empty result set handling

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Find function correctly handles an empty result set from the database query.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the database with no tasks.
    Act: Call the Find function with any ID.
    Assert: Check that the function returns an error indicating no records were found.
  Validation:
    By expecting an error message stating that no records were found, we confirm that the function responds appropriately to an empty result set.
