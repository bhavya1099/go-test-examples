```go
Scenario 1: Successful Task Retrieval

Details:
  Description: Test to verify the successful retrieval of a task by ID from the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock database with a task entry for the specified ID.
    Act: Call Find function with the ID of the existing task.
    Assert: Validate that the returned task matches the expected task details.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the Find function can fetch and parse task details correctly from the database, confirming the basic retrieval functionality.

Scenario 2: Task Not Found

Details:
  Description: Test to validate the behavior when the requested task ID is not found in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the database without any task entry for the provided ID.
    Act: Invoke Find function with a non-existent task ID.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns an error indicating the task was not found.
  Validation:
    The test ensures that the function handles the scenario where the requested task ID does not exist in the database and returns an appropriate error message.

Scenario 3: Database Error Handling

Details:
  Description: Test to check the error handling mechanism for database-related issues during task retrieval.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Simulate a database error condition while querying for the task.
    Act: Trigger Find function with the error-inducing setup.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns an error due to the database query failure.
  Validation:
    This scenario validates that the Find function can detect and propagate database query errors correctly, ensuring robust error handling in case of database connectivity issues.

Scenario 4: Scan Error Handling

Details:
  Description: Test to verify the error handling when scanning task details from the query result set encounters an issue.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a mock database with a task entry but introduce a scanning error.
    Act: Call Find function to retrieve the task with the scanning error.
    Assert: Check that the function returns an error due to the scanning problem.
  Validation:
    The test ensures that errors during scanning of task details from the query result set are captured and reported, maintaining data integrity and error transparency.

Scenario 5: Empty Result Set

Details:
  Description: Test to validate the behavior when an empty result set is encountered during the task retrieval query.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup the database with an empty result set for the provided task ID.
    Act: Execute Find function with the ID having an empty result set.
    Assert: Ensure that the function returns an error indicating no task was found.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the function correctly handles the scenario where the query result set is unexpectedly empty, returning an informative error message.

Scenario 6: Multiple Rows Returned

Details:
  Description: Test to examine the behavior when multiple rows are returned for the specified task ID in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Configure the database to return multiple rows for the given task ID.
    Act: Invoke Find function with the ID having multiple rows.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns an error indicating multiple records found.
  Validation:
    The test guarantees that the Find function detects and raises an error when the database query returns more rows than expected for a single task ID, preventing data ambiguity.

Scenario 7: Database Connection Error

Details:
  Description: Test to verify the error handling for database connection issues during task retrieval.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Simulate a database connection error scenario.
    Act: Call Find function under the condition of a connection failure.
    Assert: Check that the function returns an error due to the database connection problem.
  Validation:
    This scenario tests the Find function's capability to handle errors arising from database connection failures, ensuring graceful handling of connectivity issues.

Scenario 8: Successful Task Retrieval with Valid Data

Details:
  Description: Test to ensure the successful retrieval of a task with valid data from the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the database with a task entry containing valid data.
    Act: Call Find function with the ID of the task having valid data.
    Assert: Verify that the returned task details match the expected valid data.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the Find function can extract and return task details accurately when the database contains valid and correctly formatted data.

Scenario 9: Task Retrieval with Null Task Details

Details:
  Description: Test to check the behavior when the retrieved task details contain null values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Setup the database to return a task with null values for some fields.
    Act: Invoke Find function to fetch the task with null values.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns the task with null values as expected.
  Validation:
    The test ensures that the Find function can handle and process task details with null values from the database without issues, maintaining data consistency.
