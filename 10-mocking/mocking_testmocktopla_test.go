```
Scenario 1: TestMockTopla_SuccessfulAddition

Details:
  Description: This test case validates that the MockTopla function correctly sums up the provided integers and returns the expected result without any errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to return 5 when given [2, 3].
    Act: Call the MockTopla function with the integers [2, 3].
    Assert: Verify that the returned sum is 5 and there are no errors.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the sum of 2 and 3 is indeed 5, ensuring the basic addition functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 2: TestMockTopla_EmptyInput

Details:
  Description: This test case examines the behavior of MockTopla when an empty integer slice is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to not be called.
    Act: Invoke MockTopla with an empty integer slice.
    Assert: Ensure that the function does not return a result and an error is returned.
  Validation:
    The assertion is designed to verify that the function handles an empty input by not performing any addition and returning an error, which is crucial for robustness.

Scenario 3: TestMockTopla_NegativeNumbers

Details:
  Description: This test case evaluates the functionality of MockTopla when negative integers are provided for addition.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to return -3 when given [-2, -1].
    Act: Call MockTopla with the negative integers [-2, -1].
    Assert: Validate that the sum of -2 and -1 is -3 and no errors are encountered.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the MockTopla function can correctly add negative numbers, ensuring the handling of negative values is implemented correctly.

Scenario 4: TestMockTopla_ErrorInAddition

Details:
  Description: This test case checks the error handling capability of MockTopla when an error occurs during addition.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to return an error when given [2, 3].
    Act: Invoke MockTopla with the integers [2, 3] to trigger an error.
    Assert: Verify that an error is returned and the sum result is not valid.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the function correctly reports an error in case of any issues during addition, ensuring proper error handling.

Scenario 5: TestMockTopla_DuplicateIntegers

Details:
  Description: This test case examines how MockTopla handles duplicate integers in the input slice.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to return 10 when given [5, 5].
    Act: Call MockTopla with the duplicate integers [5, 5].
    Assert: Validate that the sum of 5 and 5 is 10 without any errors.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the function can correctly handle duplicate integers and perform the addition operation accurately.

Scenario 6: TestMockTopla_MultipleIntegers

Details:
  Description: This test case tests the ability of MockTopla to sum up a larger set of integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to return 15 when given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
    Act: Invoke MockTopla with the integers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
    Assert: Verify that the sum of the provided integers is 15 and no errors are encountered.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates the function's capability to handle and sum up multiple integers, ensuring scalability and accuracy in calculations.
