Scenario 1: TestMockTopla_SuccessfulAddition

Details:
  Description: This test case validates that the MockTopla function correctly sums up the provided integers and returns the expected result without any errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to return 5 when given [2, 3].
    Act: Call the MockTopla function with the integers [2, 3].
    Assert: Verify that the returned sum is 5 and there are no errors.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly adds the integers and returns the expected sum. This test ensures basic functionality of the addition operation in the application.

Scenario 2: TestMockTopla_EmptyInputArray

Details:
  Description: This test case ensures that the MockTopla function handles an empty input array gracefully and returns an error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla with an empty input array to return an error.
    Act: Invoke the MockTopla function with an empty array.
    Assert: Confirm that an error is returned by the function.
  Validation:
    This test verifies the error handling capability of the MockTopla function when provided with an empty input array. It ensures that the function responds correctly to invalid input scenarios.

Scenario 3: TestMockTopla_NegativeNumbers

Details:
  Description: This test case examines the behavior of the MockTopla function when negative numbers are passed as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to handle negative numbers correctly.
    Act: Call the MockTopla function with negative integers [-2, -3].
    Assert: Ensure that the function returns the expected sum of -5 without errors.
  Validation:
    By testing the MockTopla function with negative numbers, this scenario validates the functionality of the addition operation with negative operands. It ensures that the function can handle and process negative numbers accurately.

Scenario 4: TestMockTopla_MultipleNumbers

Details:
  Description: This test case evaluates the MockTopla function's ability to correctly add a larger set of integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new MockRepository and set up the expectation for MockTopla to sum up a larger array of integers.
    Act: Invoke the MockTopla function with an array of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
    Assert: Check that the function returns the expected sum of 15 without any errors.
  Validation:
    By testing the function with multiple numbers, this scenario verifies the scalability and correctness of the addition operation in the MockTopla function. It ensures that the function can handle and process a significant amount of input data accurately.
