```go
Scenario 1: Test MockTopla with a list of positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the correct summation of a list of positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a list of positive integers, e.g., [2, 3, 5].
    Act: Call MockTopla with the provided list.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned sum matches the expected total of the input integers.
  Validation:
    The assertion is crucial to validate that the function correctly computes the sum of positive integers. This scenario is essential to ensure basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Test MockTopla with an empty list

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of MockTopla when provided an empty list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an empty list []int{}.
    Act: Invoke MockTopla with the empty list.
    Assert: Verify that the returned sum is 0, as there are no elements to sum.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function handles an edge case where the input list is empty. It's important to ensure the function behaves as expected for this scenario.

Scenario 3: Test MockTopla with a list containing negative integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of MockTopla with a list of negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a list of negative integers, e.g., [-2, -3, -5].
    Act: Execute MockTopla with the negative integer list.
    Assert: Validate that the sum of negative integers is computed correctly.
  Validation:
    The assertion is necessary to confirm the function's ability to handle negative numbers correctly. It's essential to cover scenarios with negative integers for comprehensive testing.

Scenario 4: Test MockTopla with a large list of integers

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the performance of MockTopla with a large list of integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Generate a large list of integers, e.g., [1, 2, ..., 1000].
    Act: Call MockTopla with the large integer list.
    Assert: Check that the sum of the large list is computed accurately.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the function can handle a significant amount of data without performance issues. This test is vital for evaluating the scalability of the function.

Scenario 5: Test MockTopla error handling

Details:
  Description: This test validates the error handling mechanism of MockTopla.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a list that may cause an error, e.g., [1, "two", 3].
    Act: Invoke MockTopla with the list that includes a non-integer value.
    Assert: Ensure that the function returns an error indicating the issue.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the function correctly identifies and reports errors when processing invalid input. Proper error handling is critical for robustness and reliability.
