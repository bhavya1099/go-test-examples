```go
Scenario 1: Test MockTopla with a list of positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the correct summation of a list of positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a list of positive integers, e.g., [2, 3, 5].
    Act: Call MockTopla with the provided list.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned sum matches the expected total of the input integers.
  Validation:
    The assertion is crucial to validate that the function can correctly sum up positive integers, a common use case in mathematical operations.

Scenario 2: Test MockTopla with an empty list

Details:
  Description: This test validates the behavior of MockTopla when provided an empty list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an empty list of integers.
    Act: Invoke MockTopla with the empty list.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns 0 as the sum and no error.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the function handles edge cases like an empty input list gracefully, returning 0 as the sum, which aligns with mathematical conventions.

Scenario 3: Test MockTopla with a list containing negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of MockTopla when presented with a list of negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a list of negative numbers, e.g., [-2, -5, -3].
    Act: Call MockTopla with the list of negative integers.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns the correct sum of the negative numbers.
  Validation:
    Verifying the sum of negative numbers is essential to ensure the function handles arithmetic operations correctly for negative values.

Scenario 4: Test MockTopla with a large list of integers

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the performance of MockTopla when processing a large list of integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a list of a significant number of integers, e.g., [1, 2, 3, ..., 1000].
    Act: Execute MockTopla with the large integer list.
    Assert: Check that the function can handle and compute the sum of a large dataset within a reasonable time.
  Validation:
    Testing with a large dataset helps in assessing the efficiency and scalability of the function, ensuring it can handle computations without performance degradation.

Scenario 5: Test MockTopla with a nil input

Details:
  Description: This test examines the behavior of MockTopla when passed a nil input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a nil input parameter.
    Act: Call MockTopla with the nil input.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns an error due to the nil input.
  Validation:
    Verifying the function's response to a nil input is crucial for error handling and preventing unexpected behavior in scenarios where inputs are missing.

Scenario 6: Test MockTopla with a mix of positive and negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that MockTopla can correctly handle a list containing both positive and negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a list with a mix of positive and negative numbers, e.g., [2, -4, 6, -3].
    Act: Invoke MockTopla with the mixed list.
    Assert: Check that the function computes the sum of positive and negative numbers accurately.
  Validation:
    Testing with a mix of positive and negative numbers helps in verifying the function's ability to handle diverse input scenarios, ensuring accurate arithmetic calculations.
